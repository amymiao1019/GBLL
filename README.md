# GBLL
`GBLL` provides a novel methodology for multi-population mortality forecasting proposed by Ziting Miao, Han Li and Yuyu Chen. It integrates the gradient boosting techniques into traditional stochastic mortality models, by using the Li and Lee model as the weak learner, rather than traditional decision trees.

## Description
The R files associated with our paper, Gradient boosted multi-population mortality modelling with high-frequency data, (available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09983)), are provided in this repository.

## Data
The proposed method demonstrates superior forecast performance based on weekly mortality rate from 30 countries during the period 2015-2019, from the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) series published by the Human Mortality Database. Note that the text file provided has taken the reciprocal transformation of the mortality rate for Southern Hemisphere countries (Australia and New Zealand).
